# EOS CassandraHistoryAPI - GO (alpha)
EOS History API for Cassandra cluster on GO.

During the benchmark testing, real query traffic was redirected to this application.
The application works consistently at > 2000 simultaneous connections.

## Installation
#### Get source code
```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src
$ git clone https://github.com/atticlab/eos-cassandra-historyapi.git
$ cd eos-cassandra-historyapi/
```
#### 
#### Create config.json
In the project directory create file config.json.
"port" property is for the port on which the server will listen.
"elastic_url" property is for the url of elasticsearch cluster.
"seed_node" property is for the url of the node with chain_api_plugin enabled.
For example:

    {
        "port": 3000,
        "cassandra_address": "127.0.0.1",
        "cassandra_keyspace": "eos_history"
    }

For example:
```
GOPATH=/home/eosuser/go
NAMEREPO=eos-cassandra-historyapi
MIDDLEWARE_SOURCE_PORT=3000
MIDDLEWARE_DEST_PORT=3000
```
